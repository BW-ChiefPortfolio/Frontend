    title: 'Egg-in-a-Hole with Spinach & Bacon',
    image: './images/egginhole.JPG',
    mealType: 'Breakfast',
    description: 'When you make this cute breakfast-for-dinner recipe, also known as toad-in-a-hole or a one-eyed jack, you can vary it by using kale or even Swiss chard in place of the spinach.',
    Instructions: 'Preheat oven to 425°F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Cook bacon in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until crisp, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Pour the bacon fat into a small heatproof bowl. If necessary, add oil to make 2 tablespoons. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds. Add spinach by the handful and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a colander; press out excess liquid. Return the spinach to the pan and season with vinegar, ¼ teaspoon pepper and salt. Cut a 3½-inch hole in the middle of each slice of bread. (Save the rounds for another use, if desired.) Heat 1 tablespoon of the reserved bacon fat in the skillet over medium-high heat. Cook 2 slices of bread, pressing with a spatula, until lightly browned, 1 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining fat and bread. Fill each hole with spinach. Make a deep well in the spinach and break an egg into each well. Bake, rotating the baking sheet 180 degrees about halfway through, 10 to 14 minutes for soft-set yolks. Serve sprinkled with crumbled bacon and the remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper.',

    title: 'Quick Pastrami Hash & Eggs',
    image: './images/quickpastramihasheggs.JPG',
    mealType: 'Breakfast',
    description: 'When we\'re in a hurry, we love to have breakfast for dinner. Precooked diced potatoes--available in the refrigerated section of most supermarkets--help make this pastrami hash ultra-fast. (If you have leftover cooked potatoes, use about 3 cups diced cooked potatoes instead.) Serve with rye toast and sautéed spinach.',
    Instructions: 'Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and add potatoes, onion, bell pepper, paprika and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper. Stir to combine, then spread in an even layer in the pan and cook, undisturbed, for 3 minutes. Stir in pastrami, spread back into an even layer and cook undisturbed again until a crust starts to form on the bottom, about 5 minutes more. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Just after you add the pastrami to the hash, coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Crack each egg into a small bowl and slip them, one at a time, into the skillet, taking care not to break the yolks. Season with the remaining pinch of salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook undisturbed for about 2 minutes for soft-set yolks. Divide the hash among 4 plates and top each serving with an egg.',
